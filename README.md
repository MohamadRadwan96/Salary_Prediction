# Salary_Prediction
In this project, we are tasked with finding an appropriate model to predict salaries based on 7 features. This can help HR employees develop appropriate salary ranges for new positions to be offered in their respective companies. Exploratory Data Analysis is performed first, and then Predictive Modeling using feature engineering and object oriented programming is done where GradientBoostingRegressor turns out to be the best model. Afterwards, the results are displayed and saved(deployed).
